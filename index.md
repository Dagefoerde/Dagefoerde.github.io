## Short Bio

I am a management consultant in the Cloud & Digital practice of PwC Germany, with a focus on cloud and enterprise architecture. 
Prior to that, I have professionally developed various kinds of software in a variety of industries. I have a strong background in full-stack web development (Java, PHP, JavaScript, CSS) and virtual machine development (Java). Other projects in the past included desktop applications (GUI or CLI), build automation, and Linux server administration.
I have also worked (a bit) with COBOL, C#, Haskell, Python, R, Ruby, Xtend, and Xtext.
In 2020, I graduated with a PhD (Dr. rer. pol.) in Information Systems from the University of Münster, following B. Sc. and M. Sc. degrees in Information Systems.
My professional interests focus around (IT) systems architecture, domain-driven design, agile project management, DevOps, and free software.
From time to time I work as a part-time freelancer, offering development services, consulting, and training.

## Contributions to Free Software

[Free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) is an invaluable public good that is beneficial in education as well as in commercial applications.
Whenever possible, I contribute to free software projects. My major contributions to free software so far include [Moodle core changes](https://moodle.org/dev/contributions.php?tifirst=J&tilast=D), [Moodle plugins](https://moodle.org/plugins/?q=dagef%C3%B6rde), and the [Moodle-Nextcloud-Integration](https://nextcloud.com/blog/moodle-x-nextcloud-i-enjoy-being-a-part-of-two-open-source-communities-whose-efforts-empower-many-people/) \[[mirror](./Mirror/2018 Moodle x Nextcloud.pdf)].
