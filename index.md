## Short Bio

Since I founded my first small enterprise in 2004, I have professionally developed various kinds of software in a variety of industries. I have a strong background in full-stack web development (Java, PHP, JavaScript, CSS) and virtual machine development (Java). Other projects in the past included desktop applications (GUI or CLI), build automation, and Linux server administration.
I have also worked (a bit) with COBOL, C#, Haskell, Python, R, Ruby, Xtend, and Xtext.
In 2020, I graduated with a PhD (Dr. rer. pol.) in Information Systems from the University of Münster, following B. Sc. and M. Sc. degrees in Information Systems.
My professional interests focus around (IT) systems architecture, domain-driven design, agile development methodologies, devops, and free software.

## Contributions to Free Software

[Free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) is an invaluable public good that is beneficial in education as well as in commercial applications.
Where possible, I try to contribute to free software projects. My contributions to free software so far include [Moodle core changes](https://moodle.org/dev/contributions.php?tifirst=J&tilast=D), [Moodle plugins](https://moodle.org/plugins/?q=dagef%C3%B6rde), and the [Moodle-Nextcloud-Integration](https://nextcloud.com/blog/moodle-x-nextcloud-i-enjoy-being-a-part-of-two-open-source-communities-whose-efforts-empower-many-people/) \[[mirror](./Mirror/2018 Moodle x Nextcloud.pdf)]. 
The majority of my contributions to free software is tracked on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Dagefoerde/).

## CoderDojo Münster

Together with a group of volunteers, I regularly teach kids how to do programming at the [CoderDojo Münster](https://www.coderdojo.ms/). Among other interesting technologies, we use [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and [Calliope mini](https://calliope.cc/).
